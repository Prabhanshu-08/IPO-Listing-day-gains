# IPO-Listing-day-gains

**What is an IPO and why companies launch IPOs?**

Whenever a company becomes a Public company from a private company it has to get listed on Indian Stock Exchanges(NSE or BSE) before getting listed companies come up with IPOs to raise money from general public(Retail Investors), Qualified Institutional Investors(QII), and Non Institutional Investors(NII). An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors.

**Motivation of Project**

The project is build to earn some profit from these IPOs. The gains that an IPO will have on listing day(the day when company gets listed on stock exchange usually after 7-8 days later after launch of IPO) can be predicted with the help of regression machine learning models. The actual value of the gains depends on various micro economic factors and can never be predicted accurately. But a close and actionable value can be predicted by analyzing the particiaption of people in various categories that is RI, QII and NII. If an IPO is subscribed(number of people applying for IPO) in good numbers by all three categories then probabillity of a good listing day gains increases. Based on this logic this project is made.
